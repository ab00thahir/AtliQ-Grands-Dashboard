This project is a Revenue Dashboard built for the fictional hotel chain AtliQ Grands. The dashboard was created using Power BI and provides an easy-to-understand view of key business metrics, helping managers track performance and make better decisions.

**Key Features**
**Powerful Calculations:**

Used 26 DAX formulas to calculate important metrics like:
Revenue Trends (Week-on-Week growth)
Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)
Total Revenue
Occupancy % (how full the hotel rooms are)
Daily Spend per Room Night (DSRN)
Realization % (how much revenue was collected vs. expected)
Average Daily Rate (ADR) (average price per room).
These formulas make it easy to measure performance and identify trends.
**Smart Data Modeling:**

Linked multiple data tables so all information flows smoothly, making the dashboard fast and accurate.
Visuals and Charts:

**Used different charts to present data clearly:**
Line Charts: Show week-on-week revenue trends.
Bar Charts: Compare revenue across categories or time periods.
Donut Charts: Show the share of revenue from different categories.
Matrix Tables: Provide detailed numbers for deeper analysis.
KPIs with Tooltips: Added pop-ups with extra details for all key metrics.
**Interactive Dashboard:**

Added slicers and filters so users can easily explore data by time, category, or region.
Included tooltips (hover-over details) for all metrics, like revenue trends by category, to make the dashboard more user-friendly.
**Simple and Clear Layout:**

Designed to highlight the most important numbers and insights first, with detailed sections for trends and performance.
